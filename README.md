# DiscountTownOfSalem
A knock-off Town of Salem game to play with friends using Processing.

Game Phases

Day
You have 2 minutes to talk and accuse freely (You can end day early)
If you want to lynch somebody, type their name in the voting part
If some has a equal or majority votes (unless it is 1 to 1) then they get put up
Once you are put up, you have a little bit where only you can talk, then call a vote on yourself, people vote simultaneously with a thumbs up for inno, sideways to abstain, and thumbs down to guilty
If there are more guilty votes then there are inno votes, then they are lynched

Night
Rose will run the night phase! Everybody closes their eyes then witch first, then doctor goes
First, the witch selects somebody to kill, clicks on their name in the outline, then writes “attacked” under their name, then clicks back on Day in the outline
Second, the doctor first decides who they’ll heal, clicks on their name, then writes healed under their name, then clicks back on Day (don’t change who you’ll heal if you see somebody is attacked!)
