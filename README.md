Game Phases

Day
* You have 3 minutes to talk and accuse freely (You can end day early)
* If some has a equal or majority votes (unless it is 1 to 1) then they get put on trial
* Once you are on trial, you have 30 seconds where only you can talk or end your time early, then people vote simultaneously with a thumbs up for innocent, sideways to abstain, and thumbs down for guilty
* If there are more guilty votes then there are innocent votes, then they are lynched

Night
* First, the witch decides who they would like to kill and who they would like to silence if they choose to do so
* Next, the doctor chooses somebody to heal
* Finally, the seer selects somebody to watch that night
